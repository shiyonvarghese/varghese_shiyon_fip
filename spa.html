                Touching is healing; from a mother’s touch which comforts and soothes her baby to the triumphant athlete
                patted on the back by fellow athletes.Based on the same principle as human touch, massage is the oldest
                method of promoting good health, suppleness and strength. Today, the role of massage therapy is
                recognized by the general public and other health care professionals as being an effective health care
                alternative. Due to public perception and desire, massage therapy has grown into a more prominent
                position. </p>
            <p> It is a viable and respected profession promoting good health not only for your physical but emotional
                well being also. Massage Therapy is the kneading, manipulation or application of methodical pressure and
                friction of the body. Whether it is for treatment of injury, stress or for relaxation, the skilled use
                of massage through touch is used to maintain and enhance the health and well being of the entire body.
                Experience the benefits massage can offer you.</p>

                100 percent of the full treatment price will be charged to your account for cancellations and no-shows
                made less than twelve (12) hours prior to the appointment time.</p>

            <p> For Success in an Algonquin Spa Experience in Rejuvenation please pre-book your appointment. Please note
                that we cannot guarantee that even with a pre-booking you will receive your appointment due to illness

            <p> * Treatments will automatically be charged to your account, adding 13% HST. Please observe a NO EXTRA
                TIPPING policy, as we wish that you would rather take another appointment, do another activity, have
                another wine, or stay another night…..any of these will help all, far more than a single extra tip.</p>

            <p>It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or has a family emergency and we understand
                it is extremely disappointing to not have the treatment you requested. Staff will make every effort in
                finding an alternative time in the day or during your stay with another therapist, sometimes involving a
                slightly different Treatment. We appreciate our guests for being so patient during these unforeseen
                circumstances. Currently if there is a cancellation and you cannot be accommodated, there will be no Spa
                charge to your room.
                A Free Voucher for a 1 hour (Not RMT) Spa Treatment will now be provided for your next getaway at the
                Couples Resort.

                The Policy change allows us not only to make sure there is no out of pocket expense (the cost of the
                treatment) but that we will also compensate you beyond what the Couples Resort could not provide you.
                Thank You & Enjoy in Our Pleasure,
